      <description>hello again! I noticed that CloudFlare has this option for load balancing and thought, &amp;ldquo;Why not use it?&amp;rdquo;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending the past week learning how I can quickly deploy cloud instances for the blog as backup. Ansible has been a great friend for this. Being already familiar with docker-compose yamls, I was able to step into playbooks with a fair amount of confidence. As of writing, the playbook can set up the site, but I&amp;rsquo;m still figuring out how to automate SSL certificates to make CF happy.</description>

      <description>Just migrated all the dns records of this site over from Google to CloudFlare and I gotta say, I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed.
For starters, the less power Google has over me, the better. Plus I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s worth using their &amp;ldquo;domains&amp;rdquo; service outside of the name lease as it&amp;rsquo;s quite featureless. I&amp;rsquo;m not a paid shill for CF but there are so many useful features on the free tier alone</description>

      <description>hey, i&amp;rsquo;m nate. I&amp;rsquo;m 22, in L1 support, and am an aspiring sysadmin.
I grew up fascinated with computers at an early age. In &amp;lsquo;03, my parents got me a Gateway desktop and filled it to the brim with CD-ROM &amp;amp; Shockwave games. A couple of decades, certs, and a degree later, I&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed with the title &amp;ldquo;Family Tech Support&amp;rdquo; (and cursed with a -3/-4 prescription).
While not the most extroverted person I try to be the most insightful, and am huge on fine details.</description>
