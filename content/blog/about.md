## hey, i'm nate.

I'm 22, in L1 support, and am an aspiring sysadmin.

I grew up fascinated with computers at an early age. In '03, my parents got [me](../images/fridge.jpg) a Gateway desktop and filled it to the brim with CD-ROM & Shockwave games. A couple of decades, certs, and a degree later, I've been blessed with the title "Family Tech Support" (and cursed with a -3/-4 prescription).

While not the most extroverted person I try to be the most insightful, and am huge on fine details. I can spot polish and good craftsmanship when I see it, and ensure those are reflected in my work. I won't know everything from the knowledge base out the gate, but I learn by doing and can approach projects both holisitically and at a granular level.

Other interests include [motorsports](https://youtu.be/3Y2woR8U9fo), design, and game emulation. Outside of consumerism and media consumption, [electronic](https://soundcloud.com/dddbbbbb)/[beat](https://soundcloud.com/unpass/popular-tracks) production and [video editing](https://youtu.be/H4s_2byCURE) make up the rest of my time behind a screen. Pre-2008 was a great time to be creative; the amount of passion and time people put into art inspires my work ethic to this day.

I'm not the loudest or smartest in the room, but I was taught to shut my mouth and work hard. That's the lasting impression I hope to leave you with.
