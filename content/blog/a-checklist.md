*(updated 24 Jan, 2023)*

Because who needs github's "issues"

### docker mc server
- Documentation in GitHub
	- Do I *want* to write it on here?
- docker-compose.yml in a github repo
- View logs outside of ./docker-compose.yml
- Get RCON console to listen to game chat

### hugo-blackbear
- Replace nate.unpass.net pages with an example site
- in readme.md: how to get nav links to work (add blog post)

### nate.unpass.net
- Add subscribe/rss to /links
- Use cloud provider for active-passive load balancing (Linode? AWS?)
